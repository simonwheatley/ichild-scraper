# Scrapes the iChild Child Minders Directory

You'll want to amend the postcode and UNIX timestamp in the URL hardcoded into this file. Probably.

This is messy, and some of the first NodeJS I've written. Don't judge me (much).

## Usage:

```Bash
node scraper.js > output.js
# Massage output.js file to make valid JSONâ€¦ I know, I know, but whatevs
node read.js
```
